# Freshdesk-Ticketing
For this project, I created a ticketing system using Freshdesk. I wanted to familiarize myself with the ticketing system and process used in most helpdesk jobs, and I figured this would be a good way to do so.

## Overview

### Portal Setup
I created a free Freshdesk account using my email and a company name: "AG Company". After creating the account, I was created with the ticketing page:

### Email Server
I created a new email account to handle the incoming requests from the ticketing system:
