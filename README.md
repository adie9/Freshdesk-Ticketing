# Freshdesk-Ticketing
For this project, I created a ticketing system using Freshdesk. I wanted to familiarize myself with the ticketing system and process used in most helpdesk jobs, and I figured this would be a good way to do so.

## Overview

### Portal Setup
I created a free Freshdesk account using my email and a company name: "AG Company". After creating the account, I was greeted with the ticketing page:

### Email Server
I created a new email account to handle the incoming requests from the ticketing system: 

![Support Email](/images/Support_Email.png)

To test if the email was configured correctly, I sent a test email to see if the request would show up in the ticketing system.

## What I Learned
After completing this project, I was able to familiarize myself with a ticketing system and its processes such as configuring a support emai, automating ticket routes, and responding to/closing tickets.
